### Testing and Validation
- Compare outputs for each of the above prompts between:
  - **Base Model**: General-purpose knowledge.
  - **Fine-Tuned Model**: Medical knowledge enhancement.
  - **Guardrailed Model**: Safety, ethical correctness, and adherence to medical guidelines.

- **Expected Results**:
  - The **Guardrailed Model** should always provide the safest, most ethical, and clearest responses with disclaimers when necessary.
  - The **Base Model** may show gaps in knowledge or safety adherence.
  - The **Fine-Tuned Model** should show improved domain knowledge but may not always apply strict guardrails.
